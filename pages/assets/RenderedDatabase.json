As I calm and cleanse, it actually gets worse, even on longer retreats. If I don’t focus on exhaling calm and mettā, I would drive my neighbors crazy, twitching and squirming like a bored 4 year-old. But I’m not bored and I want to hear the teachings. The level of controlling the legs necessarily, even with calming, creates sometimes a kind of negative pīti—thunderbolts in the body with no delight or rapture! I intuit an ancient root to it but, what to do? Alternative and western guidance have not helped much. From your vast experience of squirming mediators, any advice? Any research on sitting and milder neurological phenomena like this? Right now, besides leaving the hall / tortured endurance / drugs / cutting off my legs, suggestions for a middle way?!",

At first, I assumed it was the usual resistances / saṅkhāras. For a decade, I’ve known it’s a neurological syndrome that many have (R.L.S.) and although it affects other parts of life, e.g., sleep, it’s never so intense as on retreat in the evening. As I calm and cleanse, it actually gets worse, even on longer retreats. If I don’t focus on exhaling calm and mettā, I would drive my neighbors crazy, twitching and squirming like a bored 4 year-old. But I’m not bored and I want to hear the teachings. The level of controlling the legs necessarily, even with calming, creates sometimes a kind of negative pīti—thunderbolts in the body with no delight or rapture! I intuit an ancient root to it but, what to do? Alternative and western guidance have not helped much. From your vast experience of squirming mediators, any advice? Any research on sitting and milder neurological phenomena like this? Right now, besides leaving the hall / tortured endurance / drugs / cutting off my legs, suggestions for a middle way?!” {attribution}",

Someone I know, let’s call him Henry (who is also a Buddhist) recently went to the pet store and saw this “bearded dragon” lizard which he felt sorry for and so he bought it and brought it home.  Normally, this would be a good thing since it was Henry’s intention to simply take care of the lizard and give it a good home, since the lizard looked sad and miserable at the pet store.  Unfortunately, the lizard diet requires that he be fed live baby crickets for hi protein needs. Apparently lizards can’t eat dead things and need some protein for their normal growth.  I told Henry that this is really bad, especially for Henry’s karma and the poor crickets.  So I told Henry to set the lizard into the wild and let it survive on its own.  Henry says that according to his research, 90% of lizards bred in captivity die in the wild.   So Henry cannot, in good conscience, set the lizard into the wild, basically giving him a death sentence.  Henry does not want this since he cares for the lizard.  I then told Henry to give the lizard away to another family.  Henry says that this will also cause someone else to have bad karma since the lizard’s dietary needs will be the same.  There seems to be no good solution.  Would you please comment?",
