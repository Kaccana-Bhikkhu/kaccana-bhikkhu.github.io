Unfortunately, the lizard diet requires that he be fed live baby crickets for hi protein needs. Apparently lizards can’t eat dead things and need some protein for their normal growth.  I told Henry that this is really bad, especially for Henry’s karma and the poor crickets.  So I told Henry to set the lizard into the wild and let it survive on its own.  Henry says that according to his research, 90% of lizards bred in captivity die in the wild.   So Henry cannot, in good conscience, set the lizard into the wild, basically giving him a death sentence.  Henry does not want this since he cares for the lizard.  I then told Henry to give the lizard away to another family.  Henry says that this will also cause someone else to have bad karma since the lizard’s dietary needs will be the same.
