Someone I know, let’s call him Henry (who is also a Buddhist) recently went to the pet store and saw this “bearded dragon” lizard which he felt sorry for and so he bought it and brought it home.  Normally, this would be a good thing since it was Henry’s intention to simply take care of the lizard and give it a good home, since the lizard looked sad and miserable at the pet store.  Unfortunately, the lizard diet requires that he be fed live baby crickets for hi protein needs. Apparently lizards can’t eat dead things and need some protein for their normal growth.  I told Henry that this is really bad, especially for Henry’s karma and the poor crickets.  So I told Henry to set the lizard into the wild and let it survive on its own.  Henry says that according to his research, 90% of lizards bred in captivity die in the wild.   So Henry cannot, in good conscience, set the lizard into the wild, basically giving him a death sentence.  Henry does not want this since he cares for the lizard.  I then told Henry to give the lizard away to another family.  Henry says that this will also cause someone else to have bad karma since the lizard’s dietary needs will be the same.  There seems to be no good solution.  Would you please comment?”  [<a href = "../tags/animal.html">Animal</a>] [<a href = "../tags/killing.html">Killing</a>] [<a href = "../tags/food.html">Food</a>]

As a woman who has felt a strong calling to the monastic life, I feel a painful split in my heart between the love I have for the Thai Forest Tradition that has changed my life,  and its seemingly uncompassionate regard for women wishing to live the Holy Life. It leaves me with a profound feeling of hurt and “less-than” mana.  I have to believe that the Buddha, who revolutionarily taught against the caste system, would not want me to feel like second class member of the human race when trying to live a life in his example.  I have tried bringing self compassion to this felt sense of my heart breaking, but the pain seems to get worse with the association of the teachers of the Thai Forest tradition who showed me the dharma and yet follow this “anti-nun" rule.  Would you share some words of healing to help my heart and restore my faith in this tradition that has so profoundly changed my life?”  [<a href = "../tags/womens-monastic-forms.html">Women's monastic forms</a>] [<a href = "../tags/thai-forest-tradition.html">Thai Forest Tradition</a>] [<a href = "../tags/women-in-buddhism.html">Women in Buddhism</a>] [<a href = "../tags/compassion.html">Compassion</a>] [<a href = "../tags/faith.html">Faith</a>]
