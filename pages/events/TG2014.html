I noticed that when we were chanting at a fast pace, several people wouldn’t be able to follow. Many of us are not familiar with Pali or Pali translated into English (combined with low light and small print). Some of us might just need a little more time. So thank you.

Both suggested noticing when the hindrances are not present. That’s been a hard concept to recognize. Today’s teachings on looking at the opposite of a hindrance when it is present allowed me to become consciously aware and look at ‘why is the opposite not present in this moment’ and ‘what I need to release the hindrance?’ I guess I’m a right-brain person.

For a decade, I’ve known it’s a neurological syndrome that many have (R.L.S.) and although it affects other parts of life, e.g., sleep, it’s never so intense as on retreat in the evening. As I calm and cleanse, it actually gets worse, even on longer retreats. If I don’t focus on exhaling calm and mettā, I would drive my neighbors crazy, twitching and squirming like a bored 4 year-old. But I’m not bored and I want to hear the teachings. The level of controlling the legs necessarily, even with calming, creates sometimes a kind of negative pīti—thunderbolts in the body with no delight or rapture!

This sort of ‘TEST’ for the labels we may jump to apply to our experience is very useful insight—‘cool’ if I may say. Are there more such ‘tests?’ P.S.

It felt too mind-focused, too ‘male’ (as more women in my view connect through the heart, or at least I do). I see a lot of heart and compassion in the Dhamma now and I am learning more about women in Buddhism.
