Been married to high school sweetheart for 40 years. Raised children together and best of friends. Lately he has gone off the deep end. Midlife crisis? - who knows, but he started drinking and acting out sexually. The feelings of shock, betrayal, hurt, anger and fear are beyond words. If new relationship I would leave, but he has been in my life since I was a child. Impossible to accept but hard to leave. How do I find the cause of suffering (noble truth) you spoke of today? And how to bring some equanimity and space around this?”  <b>[<a href = "../tags/cause-of-suffering.html">Cause of Suffering</a>]</b> [<a href = "../tags/family.html">Family</a>] [<a href = "../tags/intoxicants.html">Intoxicants</a>] [<a href = "../tags/sexual-misconduct.html">Sexual misconduct</a>] [<a href = "../tags/aversion.html">Aversion</a>] [<a href = "../tags/equanimity.html">Equanimity</a>]

Is it correct to say that the source of dukkha is in the mind (i.e., craving)? If so, what does it mean to say that birth, aging, and death—facts that we don't control and can't change—are dukkha?
