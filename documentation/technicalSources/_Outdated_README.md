# Ajahn Pasanno Question and Story Archive

## Prototype Version 1.9.3

The biggest changes made in Version 2 of the archive are to allow the spreadsheet to define multiple types of excerpts (stories, quotes, etc. rather than just questions) and allow annotations to be added to each excerpt to further describe and tag the content within. This allows us to gracefully mark up the common scenario where Ajahn Pasanno tells a good story not directly connected to the question at hand but then returns to answer the question after the story. The excerpt contains the entire audio clip. A search for text or tags associated with the story will display the entire excerpt.

### Big changes:
- The main python program is now QSarchive.py.
- DownloadCSV works
- Questions are now called Excerpts
- Excerpts may contain one or more Annotations
- Render is a new module that uses templates from the Kind sheet to produce the body text and attribution field used by Prototype to produce lists of excerpts.
- SpreadsheetDatabase.json keys designed to be read by code are now camelCase. User-facing keys are still regular case.

## Prototype Version 2.1.3

### Big changes:
- Chris Claudius contributed styles.css.
- Much more material has been added.
- Copyright assigned to Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery.

## Prototype Version 2.2
- The first excerpt in a session can now be designated as a Session Excerpt, which applies to the entire session audio.

## Caution: All documentation below is significantly obsolete

Project achitecture and command line flags - this file


## Architecture
We build the archive using a series of scripted operations of the form:

`python QAarchive.py operations [options]`,

where `operations` is a comma-separated list. Each operation is the name of a module in the `python/` directory, which are executed in the sequence below. `QAarchive.py All` runs all modules.

### Textual data flow
##### [AP QA archive main](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIOwbYh6M1Ax9O6tFsgpwWYoDPJRbWEzhB_nwyOSS20/edit?usp=sharing) - Google Sheet (in nearly final form; the full archive may contain ~25 retreats and ~2,000 questions)

↓ `QAarchive.py DownloadCSV` - not written; some easy solutions are buggy; need to research Google API; currently using gs script and manual download 

##### [csv/](csv/) - one .csv file corresponding to each sheet

↓ `QAarchive.py ParseCSV` (almost fully functional)

###### [prototype/SpreadsheetDatabase.json](prototype/SpreadsheetDatabase.json) - human-readable database file; roughly one dict entry per csv sheet; [format](documentaion/DatabaseFormat.md) nearly finalised

↓ `QAarchive.py Prototype` (almost fully functional)

###### [prototype/index.html](prototype/index.html), etc. - Text-based prototype website

#### Main website

###### [prototype/SpreadsheetDatabase.json](prototype/SpreadsheetDatabase.json)

↓ `QAarchive.py OptimizeDatabase` - Owen writes this

###### [Database.json](Database.json) - Database optimized for template engine and web-based Javascript

↓ `QAarchive.py ParseCSV BuildSite` - Owen writes this in whatever language he prefers

###### index.html, etc.

### Audio data flow (operations depend on the content of SpreadsheetDatabase.json)

The operations below execute only when necessary. If the sessionMp3 and questionMp3 options are both remote, all audio links point elsewhere, and there is no need to download or process audio files.

#### First try to download split mp3s from our Google Cloud server:

###### https://storage.googleapis.com/apqa_archive/audio/questions/TG2013/TG2013_S01_Q01.mp3 - previously split mp3 files in Google Cloud

↓ `QAarchive.py DownloadMP3` - not yet written

###### audio/questions/TG2013/TG2013_S01_Q01.mp3 - local split mp3 files

#### If this doesn't work, then download and split the files ourselves:

###### [https://www.abhayagiri.org/../AP_11_23_2013...mp3](https://www.abhayagiri.org/media/discs/APasannoRetreats/2013%20Thanksgiving%20Retreat/Audio/AP_11_23_2013_Monastic_Retreat_eve_Questions_and_Answers_1.mp3) - published Q&A sessions on Abhayagiri's website

↓ `QAarchive.py DownloadMP3` - not yet written

###### audio/retreats/TG2013/AP_11_23_2013...mp3 - local copy of full-length Q&A session; mp3 filenames match published retreat audio

↓ `QAarchive.py SplitMP3` (interface to Mp3DirectCut written and tested)

###### audio/questions/TG2013/TG2013_SXX_QYY.mp3 - audio files corresponding to question YY in session XX of retreat TG2013

#### In either case:

###### audio/questions/TG2013/TG2013_S01_Q01.mp3 - local split mp3 files

↓ `QAarchive.py TagMP3` (not yet written; there are several ID3 tag libraries for python)

###### audio/questions/TG2013/TG2013_S01_Q01.mp3 - tagged files keep the same names

## Command line

**example:** `python QAarchive.py All --questionMp3 local -vv` - Run all modules with increased verbosity and link to local question mp3 files

**usage:**  QAarchive.py [-h] [--homeDir HOMEDIR] [--spreadsheetDatabase SPREADSHEETDATABASE]
                    [--optimizedDatabase OPTIMIZEDDATABASE] [--sessionMp3 SESSIONMP3] [--questionMp3 QUESTIONMP3]

In the future, more values could be added:

autoPreferLocal - link to the local file if it exists, otherwise link to remote

autoPreferRemote - link to the remote file if it exists, otherwise link to local
