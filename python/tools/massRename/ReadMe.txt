This is the code used to convert dictionary keys to camelCase
The spreadsheet database has the format:

sheet.row.column

The sheet and column keys were converted to camelCase. The row key usually represents user-facing text, such as the name of a tag or category of exerpt. These values don't appear in the code and so remain in plain English.

The contents of the sources directory are now obsolete and have been removed.
