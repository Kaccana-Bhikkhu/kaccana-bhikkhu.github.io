Someone I know, let’s call him Henry (who is also a Buddhist) recently went to the pet store and saw this “bearded dragon” lizard which he felt sorry for and so he bought it and brought it home. Normally, this would be a good thing since it was Henry’s intention to simply take care of the lizard and give it a good home, since the lizard looked sad and miserable at the pet store. Unfortunately, the lizard diet requires that he be fed live baby crickets for hi protein needs. Apparently lizards can’t eat dead things and need some protein for their normal growth. I told Henry that this is really bad, especially for Henry’s karma and the poor crickets. So I told Henry to set the lizard into the wild and let it survive on its own. Henry says that according to his research, 90% of lizards bred in captivity die in the wild. So Henry cannot, in good conscience, set the lizard into the wild, basically giving him a death sentence. Henry does not want this since he cares for the lizard. I then told Henry to give the lizard away to another family. Henry says that this will also cause someone else to have bad karma since the lizard’s dietary needs will be the same. There seems to be no good solution.
