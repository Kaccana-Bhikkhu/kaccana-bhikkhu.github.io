When things are going “well”, I feel  sense of joy but  my mind jumps from topic to topic quickly (as though excited it’s going well).

Over these days there is an experience of heightened sensitivity to perception and the initial contact that gives rise to thought and feeling.

3,,,38:23,,"I have a moral dilemma to ask you about.  Someone I know, let’s call him Henry (who is also a Buddhist) recently went to the pet store and saw this “bearded dragon” lizard which he felt sorry for and so he bought it and brought it home.  Normally, this would be a good thing since it was Henry’s intention to simply take care of the lizard and give it a good home, since the lizard looked sad and miserable at the pet store.  Unfortunately, the lizard diet requires that he be fed live baby crickets for hi protein needs. Apparently lizards can’t eat dead things and need some protein for their normal growth.  I told Henry that this is really bad, especially for Henry’s karma and the poor crickets.  So I told Henry to set the lizard into the wild and let it survive on its own.  Henry says that according to his research, 90% of lizards bred in captivity die in the wild.   So Henry cannot, in good conscience, set the lizard into the wild, basically giving him a death sentence.  Henry does not want this since he cares for the lizard.  I then told Henry to give the lizard away to another family.  Henry says that this will also cause someone else to have bad karma since the lizard’s dietary needs will be the same.  There seems to be no good solution.  Would you please comment?",,Animal,Killing,Food,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,,,22:01,,"As I get deeper insights how conditioned the mind is, there is a sense of burden being released but also a doubt began to arise:  If the mind is conditioned, how is it even possible to arrive at the Unconditioned?  Does free will even exist or am I just pushed around by kilesas?  If the trick is to recognize that there is no free will, how can I sincerely believe that when I’m making choices to practice and do wholesome deeds, they really matter and it’s not my delusion?

Sometimes I have felt the necessity to stretch out one leg or the other in the meditation hall, but as all the monastics sit up front, I feel that I will be pointing my heel at one monastic or another and I really don’t want to be disrespectful if this is so.

5,,,4:39,,"As I consider which aspects of my life could be simplified, it occurs to me that I have two different friendships which may no longer be worth the trade off in time or energy.  After spending time with either of these friends, I tend to be more drained of my very limited energy, possible because neither is very self-aware and both talk a lot.  What is my obligation to an old friend who has recently come through a really hard time in her life or to a new friend whose health and living situation are precarious.  Is there a graceful way to bow out of a friendship without harming the other person?",,Spiritual friendship,Simplicity,,,,,,,,,,,,Spiritual friendship,130
5,,,10:07,,"I am away from a social network for almost six days which is quite incredible for me.  Normally, I spend time by distracting myself with the social network every 10 minutes.  I must check and see what people are doing, and sometimes I think is it is quite useless.  This is a different world.  However, I cannot stop using it. I am so attached to it, and I know I will go back to the same routine when I go back to my normal life.  What would you suggest to detach or use it wisely?",,Social media,Clinging,Addiction,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,,,22:17,,"This morning you talked about sense, object, contact, feeling, etc. and gave the example of the eye and object coming in contact.  The sixth sense is the heart/mind, correct?  And the object is the heart/mind?  Can you give an example?",,Sense bases,Heart/mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to believe that the Buddha, who revolutionarily taught against the caste system, would not want me to feel like second class member of the human race when trying to live a life in his example.  I have tried bringing self compassion to this felt sense of my heart breaking, but the pain seems to get worse with the association of the teachers of the Thai Forest tradition who showed me the dharma and yet follow this “anti-nun"" rule.
