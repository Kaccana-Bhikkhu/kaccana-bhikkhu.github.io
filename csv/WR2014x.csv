31,,,32:45,,"My guess is they were not smoking at Upasika Kee's, is that right?",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,33:44,,"When she is talking about the mind at normalcy, her description is having the meditation object always at least in the background, constantly in awareness, being aware of the mind-state and also doing whatever you are doing, walking, washing dishes etc. Her emphasis is on cultivating it so this is something that you would be doing twenty-four hours a day. When Ajahn Chah spoke of normalcy of the mind, did he describe it in the same way?",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,36:16,,She talks about within this state of normalcy constantly contemplating the three characteristics of all phenomena occurring in awareness. To me that sounds like juggling a bunch of things!,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,37:18,,"So the ability to hold the meditation object, go through your daily routines, keep an eye on the mind tone, and watch the stress flavor of all arising phenomenon seems like a fairly advanced practice state to arrive at and maintain twenty-four hours a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,38:14,,"She talks about making a story out of denying your defilements. Does the story of having fun denying your defilements come from that space of dwelling in that state of continuous mindfulness, or does continuous mindfulness come about from going through the suffering of forcing yourself not to enjoy anything?",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,41:15,,What do you mean when you say try something and note “it's not working” or “it is working?” How do you know it's not just another defilement sneaking in and saying “this isn't working?”,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,42:59,,Is that where when one isn't meditating per se but where virtue would come in to inform whether we have slipped or not?,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,45:08,,"She talks about virtue being the other hand of discernment in the meditation experience, and whenever discernment discerns stress, virtue is what lets go of the cause of stress, that virtue does the disbanding of it. Is virtue an unusual word to use there?",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,48:20,,"When the habit pattern of defilement is so strong, and even with the mind seeing the suffering, still the mind says, “I'm not going to give that up,” do you have any suggestions for softening that, for working with that?",,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,,50:46,,"You were talking about the positive aspect of relinquishment, and that's what will motivate giving up, that positive aspect of giving up and letting go. When it's painful giving up and you give up, you can say, “Wait, I'm just focusing on the negative aspect of giving up, I need to switch my mind to the benefits of relinquishment?”",,,,,,,,,,,,
